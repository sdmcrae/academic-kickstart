Shaun McRae specializes in the industrial organization and regulation of energy markets. His research focuses on how households respond to nonlinear electricity [tariffs] ({{< relref "tags/tariffs" >}}) and how this affects electric utilities. He also analyzes the behavior of electricity [generation] ({{< relref "tags/generation" >}}) firms in wholesale markets. Related to hydrocarbon markets, Shaun has studied the effects of [pipeline] ({{< relref "tags/pipelines" >}}) infrastructure projects as well as the [gasoline] ({{< relref "tags/gasoline" >}}) consumption and purchasing behavior of drivers.

Shaun has a particular interest in energy markets in low and middle-income countries and has worked with the World Bank and the IADB on projects related to electricity tariff design in Africa and Latin America.
